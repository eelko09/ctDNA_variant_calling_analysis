#u ctDNA_variant_calling_analysis

This project contains a jupyter notebook with a pipeline for downloading fastq file from SRA and perform variant calling analysis. The current example uses ctDNA sequences from this manuscript (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-020-00791-w).

Required files:
Human genome (Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta) and known indel files (Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf.gz and Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.hg38.vcf.gz.tbi) can be downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0/
